# Advent of Code

I'm participating in AoC because I enjoy solving these types of short challenges as a break from daily work on large systems.
If you haven't heard of AoC, [check it out](https://adventofcode.com/) and follow along yourself!

For **2020**, I developed solutions in Python3, since I had just finished five years of graduate research using it
as my primary development language. 

Throughout **2021** I have shifted my focus to honing my skills in system-level languages like C/C++ while developing
my Game Engine (I'll be posting a progress update at the end of December). So this year, I will be using AoC as a case-study comparing what I believe to be the three
most promising system languages for performance-oriented programming:

* C (with limited use of C++11 compiler features)
  * following the philosophies evangelized by [Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/about) and several members of
    the [Handmade Network](https://handmade.network/).
* [Jai (Jonathan Blow's language)](https://github.com/Jai-Community/Jai-Community-Library/wiki)
  * I believe it has the potential to be a modern replacement for C++ with more thoughtful design philosophies
    dedicated to simplicity, performance, and programmer satisfaction.
* Rust
  * The direction of the industry seems to move inevitably towards it's widespread adoption. One must 
    understand the merits and caveats of powerful social trends like Rust to make informed decisions.

## My Objectives and Non-Objectives
I __am__ interested in the following:
* Writing simple, understandable, and efficient solutions.
* Comparing solutions across proven/existing and promising new languages.
* Having fun.

I __am not__ interested in the following:
* Tuning in at the instant a new challenge becomes available to try to capture points on the leaderboard in the first 5 minutes.
  * Finding time for anything outside of work and family is hard enough. Bending my schedule around these challenge _drops_ is not a priority.
* Making my solutions as "_small_" as possible.
  * In languages that provide syntactic sugar for minifying code, the act of reducing the character count
    is often accompanied by a loss of readability and maintainability.
  * Instead, I will focus on making the simplest solutions that reveal what _actually_ occurs on the hardware,
    rather than intentionally obfuscating implementations behind "convenience" operations of a language and
    it's standard library.

Note that this is in no way a mandate for how _you_ should participate in AoC, but of course you should already know that, being the self-confident, emotionally healthy, and unapologetic individual I know that you are :).

## Get in Touch
If you have any questions feel free to open an issue we can have a chat.
Happy coding!
