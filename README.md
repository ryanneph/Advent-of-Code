# Advent of Code

I'm participating in AoC because I enjoy solving these types of short challenges as a break from daily work on large systems.

If you haven't heard of AoC, [check it out](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) and follow along yourself!

## My Objectives and Non-Objectives
I __am__ interested in the following:
* Writing modular, readable, and efficient solutions.
* Having fun.

I __am not__ interested in the following:
* Tuning in at the instant a new challenge becomes available to try to capture points on the leaderboard in the first 5 minutes.
  * Finding time for anything outside of work and family is hard enough. Bending my schedule around these challenge _drops_ is not a priority.
* Making my solutions as _small_ as possible.
  * That's a fun challenge at times, but not these times.

Note that this is in no way a mandate for how _you_ should participate in AoC, but of course you should already know that, being the self-confident, emotionally healthy, and unapologetic individual I know that you are :).

## Get in Touch
If you have any questions feel free to open an issue we can have a chat.
Happy coding!
